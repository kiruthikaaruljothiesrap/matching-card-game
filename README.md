# 🎴 Matching Cards Game by Kiruthika Arul Jothi Esra P

Welcome to my Matching Cards Game! This is a fun, interactive, and beginner-friendly web-based game built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The goal is to match pairs of cards by flipping them and testing your memory skills.

This project helped me understand DOM manipulation, grid layout systems, event handling, and game logic in JavaScript.

## ✨ Features I Implemented

- 🔁 **Random Shuffle** – Each game is different with randomized card positions
- 📊 **Moves and Timer Counter**
- 🖥️ **Responsive Layout** – Looks good on desktop and mobile
- 📐 **Clean UI with Smaller Horizontal Cards**
